## Student Projects

A description of some of the offered student projects by ANPL is given below. Projects at ANPL can be done either as part of academic coursework or as a part-time employment. The projects combine theoretical and applied research with hands-on, practical implementation. Many of the projects can lead to MSc and PhD research at ANPL.

Highly motivated strong students from various departments at the Technion (CS, EE, DDS, AE, ME etc.) are encouraged to get in touch with Assoc. Prof. Vadim Indelman.
