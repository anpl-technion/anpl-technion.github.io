- Publications managed through jekyll-scholar plugin with custom CSL styling

### Bibliography System
- Main bibliography: `_bibliography/VadimIndelman.bib`
- Research-specific bibliographies generated in `_bibliography/research-projects-bib/`
- Python scripts for filtering and processing BibTeX entries
- Custom IEEE citation style via `_bibliography/ieee.csl`

### Asset Management
- Images organized by type: `/img/research/`, `/img/team/`, `/img/funding/`
- Publications stored in `/Publications/` directory
